# Title
Similarity Narrative effect in Firm-Generated-Content engagement and moderation effect of timing and topic.
# Abstract
This study explores how firms can differentiate their content on social media video platforms like YouTube to capture audience attention in crowded spaces. Using machine learning to analyze multimodal data, it finds that a balance of distinctiveness and professional credibility in content boosts engagement. Contrary to expectations, similar narratives can enhance engagement when aligned with timely and relevant topics. Visual and audio effects don't significantly influence engagement, but strategic content variation helps firms avoid commoditization. The research provides insights for managers on leveraging tools like AI to maintain distinctiveness while avoiding similarity-driven commoditization, contributing to digital marketing and innovation theories.

# Introduction
Social media and video content have grown rapidly, partly because network technologies and applications now make creation and sharing much easier. Platforms like YouTube and TikTok are changing how content reaches audiences, shifting attention away from traditional media. Even B2B companies such as Cisco are trying short, entertaining or educational videos which help to direct customer downstream support and independent indirect customer marketing (homburg_looking_2014). Firm Generated Content has a significant effect on customer behavior  (kumar_social_2016; wang_online_2021). Research on other platforms suggests similar trends; for example, Saljoughian found that adapting responses to user sentiment can improve engagement, hinting at broader shifts in digital content strategies(saljoughian_how_2025). This shift has created intense competition for viewers’ limited attention. User reactions appear to differ based on who creates the content. Official brand videos often get quick, emotional responses, while influencer content leads to more careful engagement (Fronzetti Colladon et al., 2024). This competition is shaped by platform algorithms and the content production should be cost-effective. Prioritizing promotion over content quality can distort creator incentives, affecting how attention is distributed (ren_navigating_2025).
These patterns have led researchers to study how to attract and hold attention, especially with short-form videos, which are popular because they are quick to watch and highly engaging. Video reviews from consumers, known as C2C reviews, can be very persuasive. Parasocial interaction makes these reviews seem more trustworthy and can strengthen purchase intentions, especially when people feel unsure about a decision (penttinen_youtube_2022). Even small design choices, like thumbnails, play a role; Koh and Cui found that visual elements significantly impact view-through rates (koh_exploration_2022).At the same time, content made by firms, or FGC, can encourage users to create their own content, UGC. This creates a ripple effect where brand content sparks organic conversations (lu_ripple_2023). Still, results are not always consistent. Some studies indicate that FGC might lower purchase intention and have little effect on brand equity, suggesting these strategies depend heavily on context (santiago_is_2022). This variability extends to other industries; (qiao_how_2024) found that in healthcare, FGC’s impact depends on institutional factors such as ownership, location, and size. And even if the firm can balance it the platform play an important role in content distributions, if the production is cost-effective for creators (ren_navigating_2025).
FGC is now a key part of marketing. Companies often use several social media accounts to mix professionalism with fresh content. YouTube remains the leading platform for video marketing since the 2000s. It helps firms connect official websites with video channels to improve visibility. Its ability to stimulate UGC shows that FGC can indirectly affect outcomes like sales (lu_ripple_2023). Other platforms show similar potential, engagement strategies vary across platforms, not just YouTube.Other research emphasizes how parasocial interaction makes C2C video reviews more credible and influential. These reviews work alongside FGC to deepen consumer engagement (penttinen_youtube_2022). To keep its audience, YouTube now supports different formats, from short vertical videos to long podcasts. It aims to be the most complete video marketing platform. This variety matches the idea that user reactions differ by source: brand content often brings excitement, while influencers prompt more reflection. Design elements, like thumbnails, also shape engagement. On video platforms, firms try to build awareness important in a crowded attention economy, were likes, comments and shares can affect positively firm performance (cheng_differential_2021). 
Although many studies now look at platform strategies, we still know little about how firms make their YouTube video content different from others. Most research so far has focused on differentiation on platforms like Twitter, usually using computational text analysis (saljoughian_how_2025). YouTube, however, offers more complex and unstructured data. This makes people wonder if repeating content strategies could lead to similarity and less engagement, much like what happens with repetitive formulas in Hollywood. Advanced machine learning methods could help address this gap. They allow researchers to measure and model how distinct content really is, for instance by operationalizing "narrative similarity" through the semantic analysis of video titles and transcripts. This reveals patterns of innovation or imitation in firm strategies. This approach matches findings on Twitter that firms mirroring traditional competitors with less similar content achieve higher engagement and acquire new followers faster (lysyakov_retailer_2025).
Timing is another important way firms can differentiate. Strategic scheduling helps companies release content when consumers are most ready, maximizing attention and impact, the same when launching a new product, marketing exploration has a stronger positive influence on pioneering orientation than exploitation(liu_influence_2024). Using new technologies like generative AI can also provide an early advantage in a cyclical from process, developing, testing, communication and engaging (cillo_generative_2025). As in other firm business department studies on AI systems like CRM show that improvements in performance often depend on firm traits such as size and industry and AI-CRM facilitate B2B relationship (chatterjee_effect_2021). These insights are consistent with broader innovation research, which highlights how strategic choices help firms capture market opportunities when commercialization of innovation and or emerging technologies (datta_understanding_2015; haessler_who_2023) .
This study examines how firms try to make their video content distinct in order to maintain engagement. In theoretical terms, it may help connect marketing and innovation studies by relating differentiation strategies to professional relevance. It draws inspiration from earlier work on product-form strategy and how firms commercialize proprietary versus generic technologies depends of marketing capabilities (frias_theory_2023). Methodologically, the study uses machine learning to examine unstructured video data. This allows for a more precise measurement of how distinctive content really is. Such an approach aligns with recent advances in AI-driven marketing analytics, where these methods have shown competitive benefits (Chen et al., 2023; M. (Magie) Cheng & Zhang, 2025a). For managers, the findings could offer practical advice on balancing originality with professional standards. This is important for keeping client trust while still standing out from competitors (malik_kingdom_2025). Overall, the study aims to support both theory and practice in the changing field of firm generated content video marketing on B2B environment.
# Backgorund and Hypothesis development
On social media platforms, firms use various content strategies to engage audiences, boost brand awareness, and achieve business goals. These strategies involve sharing product details, creating entertaining content, providing customer service, running surveys and contests, and posting content that drives organic traffic to their websites. Each strategy can be customized to fit a firm’s goals, products, and target audience. Timing posts to maximize attention is also crucial. Firms typically combine these approaches and adapt them based on audience feedback.
This research examines whether close competitors differentiate their Youtube content and whether this impacts user engagement and follower acquisition. For example, Table 1 shows the videos title from competing retail firms in cloud computing. Analysis reveals distinct approaches but related to the same topic.

# Isomorphism and Dissimilarity
Scholars frequently examine the tension between isomorphism, which makes organizations more similar, and the need for dissimilarity to stand out in competitive markets. Institutional theory suggests that normative, coercive, and mimetic pressures push firms toward similarity (dimaggio_iron_1983). Research on competitive interaction supports this view. For example, when managers have information about competitor actions like pricing, they often imitate others to reduce uncertainty, resulting in mimetic isomorphism (kim_value_2025) and even when use personalize pricing affect differentiation (li_is_2024)  . A similar pattern appears in pharmaceuticals, where attempts to differentiate through strategic information withholding can ironically lead to greater convergence of technology similarity (kao_information_2025).Still, differentiation does occur under certain conditions. On digital platforms, content that differs from the norm often achieves higher engagement with traditional competitors, suggesting that isomorphic pressures and differentiation incentives can coexist (lysyakov_retailer_2025). Regulatory environments may also encourage divergence. In healthcare, for instance, external constraints lead organizations to develop varied IT portfolios, illustrating how institutional forces can produce both similarity and difference (pye_how_2025). Such dynamics also appear in B2B marketing. Mojir and Anbil found that professional ties foster trust but can also result in homogenized pricing, showing how relational norms influence convergence (mojir_value_2025). Crisafulli suggest that influencer competence is a key differentiator, that can reduce relational concerns, indicating that credibility may help counter imitation (crisafulli_competence_2022). These examples imply that isomorphism and dissimilarity are not simply opposites. Instead, their interaction seems shaped by industry-specific and environmental factors.
Although convergence can provide legitimacy, excessive imitation may reduce strategic value. High similarity can make a firm less memorable and lower engagement, while distinctiveness often supports competitive advantage. Firms with unique technology portfolios, for example, appear more attractive as acquisition targets, highlighting how differentiation matters in resource-based competition (arts_technology_2025). Distinct capabilities may also draw more competitive attention, confirming that differentiation offers benefits when applied strategically at certain points; for instance, platforms in the MOOC industry only benefit from moderated distinctiveness once they have established legitimacy relative to other competitors (taeuscher_optimal_2021). Optimal distinctiveness theory extends this idea, proposing that both extreme conformity and extreme novelty can harm legitimacy. Some studies indicate an inverted U-shaped relationship where distinctiveness drives the dynamics of platform-mediated markets, finding an optimal level of engagement on the Apple iOS platform (kang_how_2025).
This balance seems especially relevant online. Influencers, for instance, often adjust strategies based on audience feedback, repeating what works and experimenting with new variations. This suggests that neither pure imitation nor total innovation can sustain engagement alone, is necessary to find sweet spot of reinforcement and variation (jiang_play_2024). In B2B settings, a moderate level of technological similarity supports integration without redundant overlap (gao_impact_2025). Further along the value chain for IT services providers, differentiation becomes more complex, often requiring alignment between technological and operational resources, and no always is recommend mimic strategies or product from competitor (gopal_is_2020) . Overall, sustained engagement may depend not on full conformity or extreme deviation, but on a balanced approach. This could be especially true in rich formats like video, which use both visual and cognitive cues. Qiao offer a relevant example from healthcare, where the effect of firm-generated content depends on institutional context showing that even in visual media, external factors shape differentiation (qiao_how_2024). Still, empirical research exploring these dynamics in B2B video content remains limited.
However, in a B2B context, where viewers often prioritize efficiency and clarity, narrative similarity may serve a different function. Unlike consumer markets that thrive on novelty, professional audiences may value predictability. Similar narratives can act as a signal of legitimacy and professionalism, reducing the cognitive load for busy viewers and making the content easier to process. According to processing fluency theory, content that is easier to process is often perceived more positively and can lead to higher engagement. Familiar narrative structures allow viewers to quickly grasp the content's relevance and value. This is supported by research on narrative transportation, which suggests that easily processed narratives are more immersive and engaging (van_laer_extended_2014; lau_if_2025). Therefore, while distinctiveness is valuable, a degree of narrative similarity within an industry may foster a baseline of engagement by adhering to established professional norms and communication styles. We propose:
## H1: Narrative similarity in firm-generated video content is positively associated with engagement.
# Imitation Theory
Strategic imitation reinforces this trend, as firms adopt comparable practices to demonstrate legitimacy or match competitors (lieberman_why_2006). While similarity can aid comprehension, overuse of familiar patterns may lead to audience fatigue. Cognitive biases exacerbate this issue; managers often prefer what is familiar, which can result in suboptimal technology evaluations (Kumar & Operti, 2023). However, moderate deviation from dominant styles often works better than either full conformity or strong differentiation. This idea aligns with curvilinear models of distinctiveness and accommodating imitation found in earlier research (narasimhan_differentiate_2013; posen_power_2013). By mimicking the formats, narratives, or platform choices of industry leaders, firms can use proven methods, reduce risk, and reach existing audiences. This may be especially useful in crowded "red ocean" markets where innovation is expensive and firms need to fit their portfolio to specific niche markets in a nascent industry (shermon_zooming_2022). Smaller IT service firms, for example, often replicate the service offerings of larger, more established companies (ruckman_market_2015), and even in the hardware industry, creative imitation can work, but pricing is an important factor (wang_performance_2023).
The timing of content release can significantly shape its impact. In the context of a new technology's promotional cycle, early content plays a crucial role in setting expectations and establishing a dominant narrative. Firms that release content early can define the initial discourse around a technology, creating a narrative template that others may follow. This pioneering content can establish a "first-mover" advantage, where the initial narrative becomes the standard for what is considered relevant and professional. As more content enters the market, the space becomes crowded, and later content, even if similar, may be perceived as derivative or simply add to the noise. The initial stages of a technology's lifecycle are critical for commercialization and market capture (datta_understanding_2015; haessler_who_2023). Therefore, the positive effect of narrative similarity on engagement is likely to be strongest for content that appears early, as it helps establish and reinforce the emerging standard when uncertainty is high and audiences are seeking clear information. We hypothesize:
## H2: The positive effect of narrative similarity on engagement is moderated by timing, relationship is stronger when content is released earlier in the technology’s promotional timeline.
# The bandwagon effect
The bandwagon effect describes how individuals and firms adopt behaviors or preferences because they are popular, assuming that widespread acceptance signals quality or correctness (shaikh_luxury_2017). In organizational settings, companies imitate others to reduce uncertainty and gain legitimacy, particularly when adopting new technologies (fichman_real_2004). This is prominent in B2B environments where firms follow competitors into new markets or adopt similar technologies, influenced by information cascades and the need for social proof (yang_information_2023).
On digital platforms, algorithms amplify this effect by promoting trending content, creating powerful feedback loops. When a technology or topic becomes a trend, content related to it benefits from increased visibility and perceived relevance. For B2B firms, aligning their video content with a trending technology can be a powerful strategy. The popularity of the trend itself provides a signal of importance, attracting an audience that is already primed to engage with the topic. This aligns with research showing that social proof and herding behavior strongly influence technology adoption and marketing on digital platforms.
This dynamic is also relevant in B2B video marketing. When multiple firms produce content around a trending technology, they collectively reinforce its importance, and the similarity in their narratives can make the topic more accessible to a wider professional audience. While bandwagon effects can be moderated by factors like brand reputation or institutional context (qiao_how_2024; cheng_differential_2021), the underlying momentum of a popular trend provides a strong foundation for engagement. If a trend has substance, the bandwagon effect can sustain interest and benefit firms that participate in the conversation. Therefore, we propose:
## H3: The positive effect of narrative similarity on engagement is moderated by trending, relationship is stronger when the content is associated with a trending technology’s promotional.
